# Function 1: Given a protein, load ClinVar supplement and AM databases.

```{r}
# Open the DuckDB connection
library(AlphaMissenseR)
```


The ClinVar data gives a transcript ID and a UniProt accession number in the 
protein_variant field. Match these UniProt with our accession number and plot.


# Plotting functionality test

```{r}
plot_clinvar(uniprotId = "P37023") 
```
# Try another protein
```{r}
plot_clinvar(uniprotId = "Q9BQB6")
```

# Test a protein that is known to NOT be in ClinVar
```{r}
plot_clinvar(uniprotId = "P0DP23") # Gives error message as expected
```
